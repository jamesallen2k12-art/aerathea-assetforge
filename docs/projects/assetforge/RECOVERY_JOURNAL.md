# AssetForge Recovery Journal

Status: Active
Started: 2026-07-03

This journal is the short, tracked recovery trail for AssetForge work. Use it to resume after a reboot, reset, crash, power outage, or context loss.

Heavy raw outputs remain in ignored `Saved/AssetForgeResearch/` paths. This file records what matters: timestamp, intent, result, key artifact paths, blockers, and next action.

## Recovery Rules

- Run `Tools/System/aerathea_checkpoint.sh "short note"` before starting a long job, after it finishes, and before stopping for the night.
- Keep journal entries concise enough to commit.
- Keep raw logs, generated meshes, model weights, and large previews out of git unless explicitly promoted.
- Commit tracked notes and manifests at useful checkpoints, even when the research itself is still WIP.
- Do not write tokens, API keys, private URLs, or credentials into the journal.

## Entries

### 2026-07-03 07:10 EDT - Recovery hardening baseline

- Goal: protect AssetForge learning from reset/power loss.
- Local docs now capture the TRELLIS/TRELLIS.2 install, benchmark results, external-tool boundary, and project plan.
- Key tracked docs:
  - `docs/projects/assetforge/ASSETFORGE_PROVENANCE_LOG.md`
  - `docs/projects/assetforge/ASSETFORGE_PROJECT_PLAN.md`
  - `docs/projects/assetforge/reports/ASSETFORGE_CONTROLLED_BENCHMARKS_20260703.md`
  - `docs/projects/assetforge/reports/TRELLIS2_AMD_INSTALL_NOTES_20260702.md`
  - `docs/projects/assetforge/reports/TRELLIS_AMD_SMOKE_TEST_20260702.md`
  - `docs/systems/ASSETFORGE_EXTERNAL_EVALUATION_TOOLS.md`
- Latest verified AssetForge write before this hardening pass: `2026-07-02 23:15:40 EDT`, `ASSETFORGE_PROVENANCE_LOG.md`.
- Latest verified benchmark repair output before this hardening pass: `2026-07-02 23:14:50 EDT`, repaired `50k`, `20k`, and `10k` GLB/PLY variants under `Saved/AssetForgeResearch/benchmarks/.../decimation/repaired/`.
- Immediate next action: add and use an automated checkpoint script, then make a scoped WIP commit containing the tracked recovery/provenance docs.
